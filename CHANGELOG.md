## [Unreleased]

### Added (Plan 4 — Files & markdown)
- `files` table, `pages.cover_url` column, signed file URL helpers.
- `POST /api/upload` (role+size+mime gated) and `GET /api/files/[id]?sig=&exp=` (HMAC-streamed).
- Image and file attachment blocks in the editor; drag/drop + paste image support.
- Cover image picker on the page route.
- Markdown export per page (`.md`) and per subtree (`.zip`).
- Markdown import via overflow menu and via pasting raw markdown into the editor.

### Added (Plan 3 — Search & trash)
- Postgres full-text search with `pg_trgm` trigram fallback for typo-tolerant title matching.
- `searchPages` helper returning snippets (`ts_headline`) and breadcrumbs.
- `GET /api/search` route (viewer+, workspace-scoped).
- ⌘K command palette with debounced query, arrow nav, breadcrumb path display.
- Trash bin: `listTrash`, `restorePage` (cascade-aware via `deleted_root`), `hardDeletePage`.
- Trash API: `GET /api/trash`, `POST /api/pages/[pageId]/restore`, `DELETE /api/trash/[pageId]`.
- `/trash` route with Restore + Delete-forever actions.
- `autoPurge` with `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` and 1-hour throttle; fired opportunistically from trash and pages routes.
- `system_meta` key/value table for cross-process flags (currently: `last_purge_at`).

### Added (Plan 2 — Pages & block editor)
- Pages table with FTS columns/trigger and self-referential parent.
- Page CRUD APIs (create, read, update, soft-delete, move) with role gates and workspace scoping.
- Cycle detection on page move; cascade soft-delete with `deleted_root` flag.
- Recursive sidebar page tree (server-rendered) with new-page button.
- Empty-state CTA on the dashboard.
- Page route with inline title rename and emoji icon picker.
- TipTap editor (paragraph, H1/H2/H3, bullet/numbered/task lists, blockquote, code with syntax highlight, callout in 4 colors, divider).
- Slash command menu for block insertion.
- Debounced autosave (800 ms) with optimistic UI and stale-write conflict notice.
- ⌘N keyboard shortcut to create a new page.
- React `cache()` wrap on `getAuthContext` to dedupe per-request DB hits.
- Fixed Next.js `typedRoutes` deprecation.

### Added (Plan 1 — Foundation)
- Multi-tenant workspace model with email/password authentication.
- First-user bootstrap (creates workspace, becomes owner) and invite-token signup for subsequent users.
- Roles: owner, admin, editor, viewer (enforced via `requireRole` helper).
- Admin-only invite token issuance API.
- Health endpoint at `/api/health` with database probe and version reporting.
- Light/dark/system theme with toggle.
- Authenticated dashboard shell with sidebar (workspace name, version footer).
- Dockerfile (multi-stage) and docker-compose for app + postgres.
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, typecheck, test with Postgres service container, build smoke.
- Repository scaffolding: Biome (lint/format), Vitest with testcontainers, Drizzle ORM with migrations applied at startup.
